MageHand API
============

MageHand is a system for D&amp;D players to use. It helps DM's and players to focus less on the character stats and focus more on the game.
This GitHub project is for the API the site runs on.

The development of this API was done on a mac and this is why the Test.command and Startup.command files are in the project.
These are almost useless unless you have a mac and create/place the project in the Documents/Projects/MageHandAPI/ folder.
