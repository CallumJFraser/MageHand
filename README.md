MageHand API
============

MageHand is a system for D&amp;D players to use. It helps DM's and players to focus less on the character stats and focus more on the game.
This GitHub project is for the API the site runs on.

This project was a reason to help me learn JavaScript better and to see what all of the fuss was about with node.
Please note that I am still learning: I welcome constructive criticism and any advice anyone is willing to give on ways to improve this codebase.
I am not afraid to make mistakes, as there is no better way to learn. For this reason there will be many checkins of files, mostly small, and mistakes will be made.

The development of this API was done on a mac and this is why the Test.command and Startup.command files are in the project.
These are almost useless unless you have a mac and create/place the project in the Documents/Projects/MageHandAPI/ folder.
